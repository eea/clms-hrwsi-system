## [1.5] - 2019-01-11

### Added
- The snow annual map module is now operational, the associated files are:
    - app/run_snow_annual_map.py, the main application
    - python/s2snow/snow_annual_map.py, the core of the annual map processing
    - python/s2snow/snow_annual_map_evaluation.py, provide the possibility to compare with other snow products and modis snow annual map
    - python/s2snow/snow_product_parser.py, class to handle the supported type of snow products
    - doc/atbd/snow_annual_map_schema.json, parameters descriptions
    - hpc/prepare_data_for_snow_annual_map.py, preprocessing script on CNES HPC, 
    - doc/tutorials/prepare_snow_annual_map_data.md, tutorial
- Provided new data pack for tests "Data-LIS-1.5"
- Add tests for snow annual map computation
- The version of the s2snow module is now stored in file python/s2snow/version.py
- Add support and tests for zipped products in build_json.py and run_snow_detector.py,
- Add a mode to build_json.py script to configure and run LIS on Level 2A MAJA native products
- Add a tutorial to describe how to run LIS on MAJA native products
- Add a mode to build_json.py script to configure and run LIS on SEN2COR Level 2A products
- Add a tutorial to describe how to run LIS on SEN2COR products
- Add a mode to build_json.py script to configure and run LIS on U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Level 2A products
- Add a tutorial to describe how to run LIS on Landsat ARD products	
- The expert mask now includes a 5th bit for the clouds that were present in the product/original cloud mask
- The expert mask now includes an optional 6th bit propagating the slope correction flag from the product mask when available
- The cold cloud removal (pass 1.5) now use an area threshold to process only significant snow areas within clouds and reduce time.
- Link ATBD and LIS Data for test validation to their Zenodo DOI in README.md

### Fixed
- Fix all python scripts headers to avoid to mix python versions
- Fix preprocessing json option which was broken which allows to resample input DTM
- Fix typos in README.md documentation
- Change nodata management (read -32768 from input and write 0 in the
    output) in DTM resampling to avoid error in snow line estimation
    on area without DTM information 

## [1.4] - 2018-02-14

### Added
- Experimental pass1_5 function implementing the removal of snow areas inside initial cloud mask (doughnuts)
- Experimental new application to run and evaluate an annual snow map computation from a timeserie of S2 and/or L8 snow products
- Added fclear_lim parameter minimum percentage of clear pixels in an elevation band
    (default value 0.1) used to compute the snow line.
- Added option to disable vector generation
- Added options to use and manage gdal_trace_outline instead of gdal_polygonize

### Changed
- Changed default value for parameter red_darkcloud to 300 to reduce cloud sensitivity
- Changed all_cloud_mask.tif, it now include the thin clouds (in accordance with ATBD)
- Fixed method compute_percent is fix when image is empty or filled with nodata
- Fixed zs condition to trigger properly pass2 (in accordance with ATBD)
- Changed zs computation in pass2 to considers the full image imprint (including nodata pixels)
- Changed cloud mask refinement is not apply during pass1 to improve snow line accuracy during pass2
- Updated build_json.py to handle boolean parameters
- Updated build_json.py to handle new lis input parameters

## [1.3.1] - 2017-11-23

### Fixed
- Fix the intermediate data format (used 1 bit instead of type uint8)

## [1.3] - 2017-11-02

### Added
- Use gdal_trace_outline from the gina-alaska package instead of gdal_polygonize if available

### Changed

- Changed compute_cloud_mask and compute_snow_mask by OTB applications
- Added a new app to generate the JSON configuration file (build_json.py)
- Changed the way the product is generated to avoid data duplication
