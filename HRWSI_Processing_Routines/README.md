# Processing Routines

The Processing Routines are the encapsulated scientific softwares to be run on the system'w workers to produce and disseminate HR-WSI catalogue products.  
There are 3 kinds of processing routines:

- [Near Real Time Processing Routines](HRWSI_NRT_Processing_Routines), to be run as soon as possible 24/7
- [Daily Processing Routines](HRWSI_Daily_Processing_Routines), to be run once a day
- [Yearly Processing Routines](HRWSI_Yearly_Processing_Routines), to be run once a year.

The current status of  the repository exposes the scientific softwares prior to their harmization and integration. Bear in mind that, even if the scientific basis remain untouched, the code structure might evolve by the summer.
